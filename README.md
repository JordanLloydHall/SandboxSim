## Motivation
The genesis of this project came from a shared agreement between a group of freshers of Imperial College London that we should create a project before our studies began; this is the finished result. During the course of this project, the contributors learned a variety of skills such as effective communication, planning, version control, as well as a more in-depth understanding of team work and software development.

## Introduction
The Sandbox Simulator is an interactive, cellular automata-esque simulator where the experimenter may place a selection of materials into the world and see how they react with one another. So far, there are 40 different behaviours that can be exhibited by the different materials. The simulator runs very smoothly and the UI works as intended, allowing the user to quickly select different materials.

## Technology
The primary language used in this project was Python 3.8, selected for its prowess in rapid prototyping, ease-of-use, and readibility. This also allowed those who had little programming experience to contribute easily.

For the graphics library, Pygame was selected for it's extensive documentation, speed, and reliability. This was also an excellent choice for introducing some contributors to effective game development techniques.

We made use of GitHub in order to take advantage of Git's version control. This made collaborating as a group easy, and allowed us to quickly prototype new features and build upon older features.

## Getting Started
If you want to get the project running immediately or wish to tinker around with the code, this is the place to start!

### Prerequisites
This project can be run on Windows 10, 7 and Linux. The prerequisites you need to install are Python 3.8, Pygame, and Numpy.
To get started, go into Version 1/src and run the following command:

    $ python3 main.py
